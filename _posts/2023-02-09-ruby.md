Ruby is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has gained popularity due to its simplicity and ease of use. It is known for its dynamic and flexible nature, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications. Here are some of the key advantages of using Ruby:
1.  Dynamic and Flexible:   
Ruby is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables can be assigned different types at runtime. This makes the language more flexible and easier to work with, as you don't need to specify the type of a variable upfront.

<br>

2.  Object-Oriented:  
Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, which means that everything in Ruby is an object. This makes it easy to organize and structure code, as well as to take advantage of the many features and benefits of object-oriented programming.

<br>

3.  Readable and Expressive:   
Ruby is known for its simple and readable syntax, making it easy to write and understand code. The language is also expressive, allowing developers to write code that is both concise and expressive.

<br>

4.  Large and Active Community:   
Ruby has a large and active community of users and developers, making it easy to find help and support when needed. The community also provides a wealth of resources, including libraries and tools, that can be used to enhance and extend Ruby applications.

<br>

Example Code:  

<br>

```ruby
# Find the sum of two numbers
def add(a, b)
    return a + b
end

puts add(2, 3) # Output: 5
```

<br>

This simple code demonstrates the simplicity and expressiveness of Ruby. The `add` method takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The result is then printed to the console using the `puts` method.

In conclusion, Ruby is a powerful and versatile programming language that is well-suited for a wide range of applications. Its simplicity, flexibility, and active community make it a popular choice for many developers.
