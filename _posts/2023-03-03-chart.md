Chart analysis is a popular trading technique used in the stock market to analyze market trends and make trading decisions based on them. 
In this article, we will look at some popular chart analysis trading techniques.

### Moving Average
The moving average is one of the most popular chart analysis trading techniques used in the market. 
It is a trend-following indicator that calculates the average price of a stock over a certain period. 
The moving average is usually set to 5 days, 20 days, 60 days, etc., and traders use the strategy of buying when the stock price crosses above the moving average and selling when it crosses below the moving average.

### Relative Strength Index
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an indicator that measures the strength of a stock's upward and downward movements. 
It compares the magnitude of a stock's recent gains to the magnitude of its recent losses to determine whether the stock is overbought or oversold. 
The RSI is usually set to a period of 14 days, 28 days, etc. 
Traders generally use the strategy of selling when the RSI is above 70, indicating overbought conditions, and buying when it is below 30, indicating oversold conditions.

### Bollinger Bands
Bollinger Bands are a popular chart analysis trading technique that uses a stock's moving average and standard deviation to measure volatility. 
Bollinger Bands are typically set at 20 days, and the upper and lower bands are set at two standard deviations away from the moving average. 
Traders use the strategy of selling when the stock price crosses above the upper band and buying when it crosses below the lower band.

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a popular chart analysis trading technique that uses the difference between two moving averages to identify changes in a stock's trend. 
MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. 
Traders generally use the strategy of buying when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and selling when it crosses below the signal line.

### Support and Resistance Levels
Support and resistance levels are key chart analysis trading techniques used to identify price levels where a stock is likely to encounter buying or selling pressure. 
The support level is a price level at which a stock is likely to find support as it falls. 
The resistance level is a price level at which a stock is likely to encounter selling pressure as it rises. 
Traders generally use the strategy of buying when the stock price bounces off the support level and selling when it reaches the resistance level.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, these are some popular chart analysis trading techniques used in the stock market. 
Traders can use these techniques to analyze market trends and make trading decisions based on them. 
It is essential to understand that no single chart analysis trading technique can guarantee success in the stock market. 
It is always recommended to do thorough research and analysis before making any trading decisions.
