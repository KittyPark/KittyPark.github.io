Java is popular, high-level programming language that has been widely used for decades. Here are some of the key advantages of using Java:

1.  Object-Oriented:  
 Java is an object-oriented language, which means that it is based on the concept of objects. This makes it easy to design and implement complex applications, as well as maintain and reuse code.
<br>

```java
// A simple "Hello World" program in Java
public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
```
<br>

2.  Platform Independent:  
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This means that Java applications can run on any operating system, without the need for recompilation.

<br>

```java
// A Java program to calculate the factorial of a number
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Factorial {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
      int n = sc.nextInt();
      int result = 1;
      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
         result *= i;
      }
      System.out.println("The factorial of " + n + " is " + result);
   }
}
```

<br>

3.  Large Standard Library:  
Java comes with a large standard library that contains many useful classes and interfaces for tasks such as input/output, networking, and database access.

<br>


```java
// A Java program to download an image from the web
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class DownloadImage {
   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com/image.jpg");
      InputStream in = url.openStream();
      OutputStream out = new FileOutputStatic(new File("image.jpg"));
      byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
      int length;
      while ((length = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
         out.write(buffer, 0, length);
      }
      in.close();
      out.close();
   }
}
```
<br>

4.  Robust and Secure:  
Java is designed to be a robust and secure programming language, with built-in features such as automatic memory management and exception handling. This makes it a great choice for mission-critical applications.

<br>

```java
// A Java program to catch an exception
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DivideByZero {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
      int n = sc.nextInt();
      try {
         int result = 100 / n;
         System.out.println("Result: " + result);
      } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
         System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed");
      }
   }
}
```

<br>


5.  Large Community :  
Java has a large and active community of users and developers who contribute to the language and its libraries. This community makes it easy to find help and support.
